and lost workdays in both military and non-military populations. To better 
understand these infections and their outcomes, the Infectious Diseases Clinical 
Research Program has enabled nine major ARI clinical research protocols in the 
last decade, including observational studies and trials, spanning emerging and 
reemerging ARI threats including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 
2, influenza, adenovirus, entero/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory 
syncytial virus, and other pathogens. These protocols have resulted in 
epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and biospecimens from over 26,000 
participants, most of whom were beneficiaries of a geographically distributed 
Military Health System.
METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Repository Protocol establishes a 
unique Department of Defense (DoD) research resource through the pooling of data 
and specimens from nine ARI protocols into a master, standardized database with 
a linked specimen repository. This will enable further targeted scientific 
questions in participant-level pooled meta-analyses and will serve as an 
on-demand repository for rapid assay development, sample size estimations for 
prospective studies, and observational study/clinical trial design (including as 
part of future rapid pandemic research response). Accordingly, the objectives 
and study design of this protocol are broad. This protocol will allow analyses 
on outcomes including: (i) short-term ARI outcomes such as hospitalization, work 
days lost, symptom severity and duration; (ii) post-acute ARI outcomes, 
including persistence of symptoms, return-to-health, post-ARI medical 
encounters; (iii) vaccine effectiveness for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
influenza, and adenovirus vaccines; (iv) ARI infection and vaccination elicited 
immune responses (humoral, T-cell, other); (v) therapeutic effectiveness of 
COVID-19 and influenza antivirals (acute symptoms, hospitalization, post-acute 
sequelae); (vi) effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., 
masking) against infection; (vii) prognostic and mechanistic host viral 
biomarkers which correlate with the above outcomes; (viii) ARI diagnostic assay 
validity and performance. This repository protocol is inherently broad in scope; 
the collation of standardized data and phenotype-linked specimens is a 
fundamental, primary objective.
DISCUSSION: This protocol will support statistical and laboratory analyses, 
including activities related to rapid epidemic response such as assay 
development and rapid sample size calculations for clinical trials. A series of 
more specific scientific questions from current and future collaborators will 
leverage this joint database and specimen repository; these questions will 
target important aspects of ARI infection, transmission, outcomes, and 
treatment. Future protocols (and ongoing data from existing IDCRP protocols) 
will be added to this collaborative repository protocol."

"40600979","Scoping review and recommendation to establish standardized best practices for resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in combat casualties: A North Atlantic Treaty Organization exploratory team report.",2025,"Journal Article","OBJECTIVES: The increasing percentage of follicular neoplasms among thyroid 
nodules submitted to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology raises concerns 
regarding diagnostic uncertainty and clinical management. This study aims to 
investigate the factors contributing to this phenomenon, including the influence 
of the implementation of ultrasound (US) risk stratification systems and of the 
third edition of the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 1255 patients (1470 nodules) diagnosed during 
the first 9 months of 2023, in a single institution, was analysed.
RESULTS: US classifications are used in 77.8% of the reported nodules, 
predominantly EU-TIRADS (44.4%) and ACR-TIRADS (32.2%). Bethesda category IV 
(follicular neoplasm) diagnoses increased from 7.7% to 11.8% after adopting the 
third edition, although without statistical significance. Notably, 39% of 
nodules were submitted to FNA without US indication, emphasising the need for 
improved adherence to guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the significant increase in follicular 
neoplasms among nodules with US indication for FNA. The transition from the 2nd 
to the 3rd edition of the Bethesda system increases the probability of 
indication for surgery by 1.5-fold, while the US indication for FNA increases 
the probability of indication for surgery by 1.6-fold, and demonstrated that the 
nodules with surgical indications (Bethesda categories IV, V, VI) increased from 
5.3% in 2021 to 11.4% in 2023. Despite limitations, this work underscores the 
importance of aligning FNA practices with evidence-based recommendations to 
optimise patient care and minimise overdiagnosis."

"40576296","Long-term outcomes in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia treated with hydrocortisone modified-release hard capsules.",2025,"Journal Article, Clinical Trial","Polygenic scores (PGSs) for body mass index (BMI) may guide early prevention and 
targeted treatment of obesity. Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people 
(4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% 
European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 
23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The 
multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank 
participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% 
in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children 
with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5 years to adolescence, 
with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth 
nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 
11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved 
prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs 
were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle 
intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in 
the first year (0.55 kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, 
these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, 
particularly when implemented early in life."
